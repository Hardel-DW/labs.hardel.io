# Information :
This folder contains the resources for the project, so theses resources are not used by the project itself, but are here to help you to create your own project.  
Every resources are public and can be used by anyone.  

I will try to maintain and update the resources.

## Databases seed data :
- minecraft_items.sql : Contains all databases items from minecraft.

## Assets :
- items_assets.json : Contains all items\blocks from minecraft, optimized for the project with webp extension. The size of the images is 64x64 specifically for the craft page which does not require larger images.
